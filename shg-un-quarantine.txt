        A standard process to quarantine and restore IoT Devices
                 draft-richardson-shg-un-quarantine-00

Abstract

   The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) is a tool to describe the
   limited access that a single function device such as an Internet of
   Things device might need.  The enforcement of the access control
   lists described protects the device from attacks from the Internet,
   and protects the Internets from compromised devices.

   This document details the process which occurs when a device is
   detected to have violated the stated policy.  The goal of these steps
   is to ensure that the device is correctly removed from operation,
   fixed, and if possible, restored to safe operation.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud] describes the format of the Manufacturer Usage
   Description (MUD) files.  MUD files provide a set of network Access
   Control Lists (ACL, pronounced [ak-uhl]) that describes the expected
   traffic from a device, such as an Internet of Things (IoT) device.

   MUD files are used in a number of projects, including the CIRALabs'
   [SecureHomeGateway] (SHG) project.  In this project a home gateway
   ("router") is enhanced to be able to use MUD files to describe the
   traffic expected from all connected devices.  If a device does not
   have a MUD format description, then the project can provide a broad
   set of traffic expectations based upon categorization of the device
   by the home owner.

   This document is about the process to be followed when a device is
   observed to be violating the ACLs applied to it.  While this document
   will identify network protocols (and gaps where no protocol exists)
   as appropriate, the goal of this document is more about the human
   process.  Specifically, who gets called, and in what order.  Who
   makes each call, and how are they identified.

   In addition, what kind of data needs to be shared among the parties
   and what are the privacy and human rights implications of sharing the
   required data.

   Finally, in the security considerations section of this document some
   concerns about prevention of so-called "SWAT"ing ({swatting}), where
   an attempt might be made to take a location or network offline
   through phony reports.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document is not a protocol specification, but rather a Best
   Current Practices in the area of human operations.  While this is
   sometimes called a "Standard Operating Proceedure" (SOP), this
   document should not be considered the actual SOP for an organization,
   but rather be referrenced.

   The terminology [RFC2119] the key words such as "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119.  In the context of this human
   protocol, they do not describe network protocol interoperability
   requirements, but rather constraints upon how the humans need to
   operate in order to avoid unsafe situations.

1.2.  An overview of the stages of operation

1.3.  Cast of Characters

   In order to describe a number of scenarios through examples, a number
   of actors are required.  This section details the different actors
   and gives each a pseudonymous names taken from Bugs-Bunny cartoons.
   The intent is to create instant recognition among many readers.  This
   section will be revised as needed to add characters as needed.

   o  ACME products: the maker of a device.

   o  Wiley Coyote: a user of products with malicious intent

   o  Bugs Bunny: a knowledgable user of products, aware of intended
      purpose

   o  Road Runner: an innocent user of products, unaware of how it works

   o  Foghorn Leghorn: an operator of a residential/consumer network

   o  Yosemite Sam: an operator of a cloud/data-center network

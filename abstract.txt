Abstract:
   Increased use of automated IoT security mechanisms such as the
   Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD, RFC8520) means that devices will
   increasingly be "taken offline" for possible violations of stated
   security policy.
   Detection of a possible violations is just a first step, there are
   a number of additional steps necessary to return the device to
   correct operation, to update the security statements, or possibly
   to discard the device as irreperable.
   For residential IoT devices, other than a possible government
   agency, the only clear organization that the resident has a relationship
   with is the Internet (access) Service Provider (ISP).  The ISP helpdesk
   will invitably take the call and needs to pass the call off to a
   manufacturer or other entity, providing as much information as possible
   in an automated way.
   This document is about the process (the playbook) to be followed, and
   it attempts to identify which steps of the protocol can be automated with
   existing protocols, with up-coming protocols, and where there are gaps
   that could be automated.
